# **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) Framework**

## **ðŸ“– Overview**
This repository provides a modular and extensible framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (**PDEs**) using **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**. The framework supports **1D, 2D and 3D**, and **scalable extensions**, incorporating **differential operators, boundary conditions, adaptive collocation strategies, and custom loss functions**. 

Additionally, this framework allows benchmarking PINNs against **Neural Operators** such as **Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)** and **Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO)**, enabling comparisons across **different learning paradigms**.

## **ðŸ”¹ Features**
âœ” **Modular & Scalable** â€“ Easily extendable for different PDEs and PINN architectures.  
âœ” **Customizable PINN Models** â€“ Supports **1D, 2D and 3D PINNs** with adaptive techniques.  
âœ” **Flexible PDE Definitions** â€“ Users can define PDE operators and boundary conditions dynamically.  
âœ” **Adaptive Collocation Sampling** â€“ Focuses training on regions with high PDE residuals.  
âœ” **Custom Loss Functions** â€“ Includes physics-based loss terms and trainable weighting strategies.  
âœ” **Configurable via YAML** â€“ Hyperparameters and model settings are easily adjustable.  
âœ” **Benchmarking & Experiment Tracking** â€“ Supports **comparison between PINNs, FNOs, and PINOs**.
